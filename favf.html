                Adobo is often considered the national dish of the Philippines. It’s a savory stew made with meat (usually chicken, pork, or beef), marinated and simmered in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. The dish can be cooked in many variations, with some regions adding coconut milk or potatoes. It’s known for its balance of tangy, salty, and savory flavors, and the meat becomes tender and infused with the marinade as it simmers. Adobo is often served with rice and is a staple in Filipino households.

                Ginataang Kalabasa

            <p class="text-base md:text-xl mb-8">
                Ginataang Kalabasa (literally "squash in coconut milk") is a comforting Filipino dish that uses kalabasa (squash), typically paired with sitaw (string beans), and cooked in coconut milk. The vegetables are usually sautéed with garlic, onions, and shrimp paste (bagoong) for added depth of flavor, then simmered in coconut milk until the squash is tender and creamy. It may also include meat or seafood like pork, shrimp, or fish, although vegetarian versions are also common. The richness of the coconut milk and the sweetness of the squash combine to make a delicious, hearty dish.
